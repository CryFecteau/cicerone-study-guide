        text: 'There are number of factors that influence how intoxicated a person becomes. Weight is one of them, a small person may get drunk faster then a big person, but remember body fat does not absorb alcohol. Alcohol is absorbed into the bloodstream and metabolized by the liver, but is also burned like any other calorie and some is also excreted as alcohol. For instance a breathalyzer measures alcohol that is expelled in your breath.'

        text: 'If a person is eating, the alcohol absorption is delayed. Although the alcohol is still there, it is absorbed in the system at a slower rate. Drinking soda, coffee, or water does not eliminate alcohol; rather, it merely slows absorption by diluting what is in the stomach. There is no magical remedy to stop intoxication when drinking alcohol(except by not drinking as much or at all).'

There are two beer glass cleaning systems: 1. Dedicated automaic glass washer(not used for anything else as this may cause residue to be left on the glass) 2. Classic manual cleaning using a three-tub sink. No matter whar system you use, detergent must NOT be fat or oil base as this will inhibit foam from forming durning the pour.'

        text: 'Empty Glass: </br> Sheeting Test: wet glass, empty, hold up to the light and inspect for even sheeting(formation of doplets or webbing indicates the glass is NOT clean). When the glass is wetted with water, the water will evenly sheet off from the inside surface. If the water is seemingly repelled from and spots up on some areas, there is an oil based film on the glass and therefor considered dirty. </br> Salt Test: wet glass, spronkle sat throughout, places where salt does not adhere are not beer clean. If the salt sticks to the entire inside surface of the glass, it is beer clean. </br> Full Glass: </br> Head: size, shape, and retention. When pouring beer you should see a nice head form. If it quickly dissipates or the beer looks flat, the glass is not clean. </br> Bubbles: clining to the sides of the glass indicates a dirty glass. </br> Lancing(know sometimes as Belgian Lace): Happens as the beer is consumed. A residual of the head sticks to the side of the glass as the beer is consumed. They are like tree rings: you can actually count how many sips it took to drink the beer. If ring are not present, the glass is not clean. '

        title: 'Glass Temperature',
        text: 'Room temperature is the best start of beer glassware, particulary craft beer. </br> Chilled glassed are OK for domestic lager but unnecessary. If glasses are chilled be sure it is done with dry glasses and a dedicated cooler. Wet glasses will freeze a sheet of ice inside the glass and retain any food smells. </br> Frozen or frosted glass is not recommended. It will cause foaming as the beer explodes when hitting the over-cold surface and it will make the beer too cold(losing its taste). Beer served at near-frozen temperatures retains more CO2 gass which results in a fuller feeling(because the glass comes out in your stomach). This is why those ice cold Bud/Miller/Coors lights can feel so filling, even though ther are "light" beers. Remember, The coldness also numbs the taste buds which suppresses taste.'
